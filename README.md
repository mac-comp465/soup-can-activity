# Soup Can Activity

In this activity, you will practice creating a mesh using a VBO and VAO and texturing the mesh

## Getting Started

Clone and generate the project files:

```
cd yourCodeDirectory
git clone https://github.com/mac-comp465/soup-can-actvity
cd soup-can-activity
mkdir build
cd build
cmake-gui ..
```

## To Do

Inside onRenderGraphicsContext() on the first frame reset the _mesh to draw a cylinder. Set the texture coordinates to wrap the campbells.jpeg texture around the outside.
